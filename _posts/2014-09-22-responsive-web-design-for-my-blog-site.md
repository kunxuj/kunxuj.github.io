I mentioned in my previous blog ["Improving my blog site continuously"](http://kunxuj.github.io/improving-my-blog-site-continuously/), my blog site looks very ugly on all mobile devices. To resolve this issue, I use "Responsive Web Design" (RWD) technologies. There are two major components in RWD:   

- Fluid Grid layout
- Media Queries 

There are other components in RWD, for my blog site, I mainly focus on these two components. 

Perhaps Bootstrap is the most popular framework to support RWD. After I assess it, I think it's a big project to refactor my blog site to apply it (Bootstrap). Therefore, to save time, I change my CSS files and the main html file directly to support RWD.
