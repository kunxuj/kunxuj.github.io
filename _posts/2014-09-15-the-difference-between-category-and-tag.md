If you use a key word "category vs tag" to conduct a Google seach, most likely, the first article you found is a Wordpress article [Categories vs. Tags](http://en.support.wordpress.com/posts/categories-vs-tags/).  

The explanation in that article is also applied to my blog site. To be clear, I plan to use them in the following ways:  

* Category is the first level and general categorization.   
* Tag will be used as a more detailed categorization. Since there is no sub-category concept in my blog site, I may use tags as sub-categories.  
* Both categories and tags are optional in my blogs. For better categorization, any my post will use one or both of them.
